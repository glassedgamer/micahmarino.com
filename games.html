        <h3><a href="https://codehs.com/sandbox/id/midterm-vYVauw/run" >"Zombie Dodger"</a></h3>
        <p>Created for my Video Game Design class midterm of my Junior year of high school. We were given around a month to create <br>
          a custom JavaScript game based on the material we learned up until that point. I decided to create a simple game where you <br>
          have to dodge zombies for 30 seconds to win.
